# Cloud9-Exploit-With-Reverse-Shell-Payload
This is a Cloud9 exploit with a reverse shell payload. This is designed to open a reverse shell for an open port running Cloud9 in an insecure way. 
I created this when trying to test the security of a IoT network for my research that used beagleboards with Cloud9 running on an open port.

*Note: This is to be used for ethical testing of security. I am not liable if you use this software for something illegal.*

*Note 2: This was created a while ago where I do not have access to the devices I used. Ideally I would update this to 
replace the use of the web browser with simple GET and POST requests.*
